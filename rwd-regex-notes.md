# Regex

Regular expressions allow us to extract information from any text by searching for one or more 
matches of a specific pattern or sequence. For example:

`^The` - matches any string that starts with **The**
`end$` - matches a string that ends with **end**
`^The end$`- exact string match (starts and ends with **The end**)
