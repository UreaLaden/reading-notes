# Notes on SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is is the de-factor standard for interacting with relational databases. It is a common misconception that the word relational implies relationship between tables. A relation is a mathematical term that is roughly equivalent to a table itself. When used in conjunction with the word database, we mean to say that this particular system arranges data in a tabular fashion.

**Database Management System (DBMS)**: Software used to manage a digital database
**Data Definition Language (DDl)** commands allow you to create or modify your database structure.
- `CREATE TABLE`, 
- `ALTER TABLE`, 
- `DROP TABLE` 
**Data Manipulation Language (DML)** commands are used to manipulate data stored inside your database.
- `INSERT`,
- `UPDATE`,
- `DELETE`
**Data Query Language (DQL)** commands are used for querying or selecting a subset of data from a database.
- `SELECT`
**Data Control Language (DCL)** commands are used for controlling access to data within a database, commonly used for granding user privileges
- `GRANT`,
- `REVOKE`
**Transaction Control Commands** are used for managing groups of statements as a unit of work.
